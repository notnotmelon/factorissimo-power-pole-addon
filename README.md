[![Release](https://github.com/notnotmelon/factorissimo-power-pole-addon/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/notnotmelon/factorissimo-power-pole-addon/actions/workflows/release.yml)

### Power is no longer everywhere on the factory floor, you must extract it out of the power manager with power poles

https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Factorissimo2

If you want to generate power inside a factory building, you must also connect the generator to the manager

The recursion and overhead lighting technologies work the same as normal

The mod uses no lua while running, and will have zero impact on your UPS
